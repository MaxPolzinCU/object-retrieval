# room-recognition
ITEC 5920 Design Project: This project performs real-time object detection on a live video feed, then determines what type of room it is in based on the detected objects. Additionally a user can request an item to be found and the algorithm can search the video feed for the item and give the most likely type of room that item would be found in.
